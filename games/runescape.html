            <p>For the longest time I have played Runescape (RS3, not OSRS). But quit because of the frustration that the company caused. However,
            they have since removed frustrating parts, so I decided to once again play it.</p><br><br>

            Here is the list of characters I'm currently playing. I am eventually planning on playing an Ironman character.
