            <p>I am a typical nerd, otaku, geek, whatever you want to call it. I enjoy playing games. When it comes to games, I just play whatever I fancy.
            There aren't many genres I dislike, but my preference will always go to non-competitive games, unless it's with friends.</p>

            Pages related to games I play can be found here:
