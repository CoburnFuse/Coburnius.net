            <p>There's a lot of media I like, mainly games and anime. So I figured I would give recommendations of stuff I enjoy.
            The writing can be slightly incoherent, so you should take these as ramblings of excitement about the things I enjoy,
            rather than a serious attempt at reviewing them. That being said, these are still things I genuinely recommend.
            I have seperated these in different categories to avoid future clutter.</p>

            Pages related to recommendations can be found here:
            <table>
                <tr><td><a href='/recommendations/anime.html' title='Anime recommendations'>Anime recommendations</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href='/recommendations/games.html' title='Game recommendations'>Game recommendations</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href='/recommendations/other.html' title='Other recommendations'>Other recommendations</a></td></tr>
            </table>
