            There's a lot of media I like, mainly games and anime. So I figured I would give recommendations of stuff I really like.
            I have written a small summary of what I like about these media, of course there is much more to it than just what's written here,
            however, it still think it gives an idea. More will be added when I think of more stuff to add.<br><br>
            
            Here is list of games I really like:
