            I have created various things, most of these during my school period. Most of these have a story behind it as well, even if these are as simple as liking the media.
            They're also all of varying quality, which makes sense considering I've gotten more experience over time.
            Of course, I still want to create a variety of things, possibly including more sites, tools, and even small games.<br><br>

            This is a list of printable stuff I have made:
            <table>
                <tr><td><a href="https://cdn.coburnius.net/creations/K-ON%20Book.pdf">K-ON Book (2015, PDF)</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="https://cdn.coburnius.net/creations/MMSF%20Kalender.pdf">Megaman Starforce calendar (2015, PDF)</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="https://cdn.coburnius.net/creations/Neptunia%20Booklet.pdf">Neptunia booklet (2014, PDF)</a></td></tr>
            </table>
            These are galleries of games I worked on or have made concepts for:
            <table>
                <tr><td><a href="/creations/shsk.html">Shattered Skies (2017, 5 images)</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="/creations/skdt.html">Shattered Skies Distant Thunder concept (2019, 2 images)</a></td></tr>
            </table>
            I have also created some other sites which you can access from here as well:
            <table>
                <tr><td><a href="https://creations.coburnius.net/mainframe/">Hacknet themed site (2016)</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="https://creations.coburnius.net/shitemas/">Shitemas (2018)</a></td></tr>
            </table>
            Miscellaneous stuff I have created, like tools for games:
            <table>
                <tr><td><a href="https://creations.coburnius.net/book-of-answers/">Page of Answers (2025)</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="https://ttrpg-toolbox.mistralton.net/">TTRPG Toolbox (2025)</a></td></tr>
            </table>
