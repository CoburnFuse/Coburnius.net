            <p class="recommendationQuote textCenter">“Hi! Lea! Hi!”</p>

            <p>Originally, a friend kept pestering me about playing this game (as a joke), because it's one of his favorite games. 
            I went in open-minded, and ended up really liking it, even if I had a few frustrations, which was me being impatient more than anything. 
            That didn't keep me from enjoying this game though!</p>

            <p>I think the strongest part of the game is the characters, and especially the main character. 
            While Lea is a (mostly) silent protagonist, she has so much personality with her expressions and the few words she speaks. 
            The story is also great and is more personal rather than a typical “save the world” kind of story. 
            Another strong part of the game is the music, being energetic during battles, and atmospheric outside of battles, often just living rent-free in my head.</p>

            <p>The puzzles in this game, while not my favorite, are also pretty well designed overall. 
            I'm not going to deny that this brought me the most frustration because I get impatient fast. However, it always felt satisfying whenever I finished a puzzle. 
            There are also enough sidequests to do if you need a break from the story.</p>

            <p>Another impressive thing, this game is entirely made in HTML/CSS/Javascript. So this game is entirely playable in your browser, and guess what, 
            the demo of the game still is! Despite that, it's worth checking out if you want a solid action RPG with great puzzle elements.</p>
