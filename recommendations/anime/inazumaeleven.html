            <p>It's not a secret that I am not a fan of football at all. But what I do like is over the top stuff. 
            Inazuma Eleven very much is that. To the point where I even have all the games (as far as I can in Europe) and watched the entire anime, 
            as well as the sequel at least thrice despite the length.</p>

            <p>I think what stands out most to me is the cast. Despite the large main cast, they still all feel unique in their own way, 
            both with personalities and special moves they are using. The teams feel pretty diverse, each with their own quirks too. 
            The story (or stories, since there are multiple arcs) has kept me quite interested too, with some parts being quite dark for something that is aimed at children.
            Naturally, the music is also done well, helping make the scenes look even more intense.</p>

            <p>Of course, what stands out most are the special moves, which is pretty much what Inazuma Eleven is, 
            football with over the top moves like a flaming tornado to kick a ball, or a hurricane just to pass someone. Of course, all anime logic, 
            nobody would actually survive this normally. Despite its age, it's still quite a vibrant anime and generally pleasant on the eye.</p>

            <p>If you aren't sure if this is for you, I'd say give the first half of the first season a shot (which is 13 episodes.) 
            If you want to pass because this is football, give it a shot anyway, after all, I really don't like football, and I consider this to be my favorite anime. 
            And perhaps if you like the original, give the rest a shot too!</p>
