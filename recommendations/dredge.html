            <p class="recommendationQuote textCenter">“I am a collector - of many things; art and artifacts, treasures and truths…and curios that occupy the periphery of desire.”</p>

            <p>There is something relaxing about the eldritch nature of this game. 
            The atmosphere doesn't look all that inviting, but the gameplay loop makes for a really relaxing game. That is, 
            if you don't take the constant push to insanity into account.</p>

            <p>The entire premise of the game is just fishing and dredging up wrecks. However, you will quickly see that some fish you catch are strange and corrupted, 
            and give this unsettling feeling, giving you the feeling there is much more to this place than it appears. 
            While I'm personally not a big fan of all the eldritch horror stuff, something about this game kept me relaxed despite all of this. 
            Of course, I can't talk about Dredge without talking about the graphics of the game. 
            The portraits have a very abstract-ish style to it, that fits the premise of the game quite well. Everything looks gloomy and somewhat depressing. 
            Even the music is really fitting, being all somber and such. I may or may not have used the music of this game during DND sessions before as well.</p>

            <p>While being mostly on water, the places you go through are interesting and feel unique. With each place having interesting lore and personality. 
            The characters you meet in the game, despite being still images, bring a lot of life into the game as well. 
            Though, of course, since you are on the sea a lot to fish, you won't always see the characters a lot. 
            However, I have to admit that inventory management can at times be frustrating, especially in the beginning, 
            as it's a lot of puzzling to figure out what fits.</p>

            <p>If you are into relaxing yet eerie games, this is a great game to pick up. While it can feel grindy, 
            there is little to no pressure doing anything and taking your time is really the best way to tackle this game. 
            Be careful on sea though, danger is lurking everywhere!</p>
