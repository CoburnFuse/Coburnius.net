            <p>The best way people can describe this is, is a war crime simulator. Which I agree with. However, there is much more to this than just war crimes. 
            Rather than calling this a full on game, it's better to call this a story driven simulator.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of things to do in this game. If you want to have a friendly colony that wants to help everyone, or at least as much as possible, you can do that. 
            Or if you want to be a bunch of raiding pricks that harvest organs for money, that too is possible. 
            Perhaps you just want to make a lot of money by producing drugs, that is also entirely possible in Rimworld.</p>

            <p>Graphically it's not that impressive, however, it works very well for this game. The soundtrack however, absolutely fantastic. 
            There are also tons of mods that can improve the game a lot. It's very likely that if you want something, there's a mod for it. 
            There's also a bunch of expansions (of varying quality), each with its own theme. I'm personally quite a fan of the Biotech expansion, 
            adding robots and gene manipulation.</p>

            <p>This game is worth picking up if you want a sandbox-y game, and it's also best to go into this game with as little knowledge as possible, 
            as losing is in fact fun. I could have said a lot more about this game, but you really just need to experience this yourself!</p>
