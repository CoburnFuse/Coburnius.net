            <p>When the first trailer was dropped, I watched it countless times, despite it not showing any helpful info. 
            I was so incredibly excited about the DLC. When it came out, of course, I immediately played it and I was not absolutely disappointed by it. 
            This time however, it's not about Fei, but about Honest and her wish to escape.</p>

            <p>Just like the main game, it's snake combined with bullet hell, with amazing music. 
            However, they decided to put some puzzle gameplay in it as well, which, simple, but still fun!  The bosses are a bit more goofy than the main game, 
            but they are incredibly well designed and in context are great. There's also four bosses that are just old arcade games made to work with this game.
            There is one boss specifically, the penultimate boss, that I find just incredibly fun. Not to say that that the other bosses aren't though, because they absolutely are.</p> 

            <p>But just like the main game, there are some frustrating parts of bosses where you just need to take a step back and calm down a little bit before trying again. 
            But it really doesn't help that my general playstyle is quite aggressive either. It's also not as long as the main game, but the quality is as good, 
            if not better than the main game.</p>

            <p>If you like the main game, you really should play the DLC as well. Especially if you want a good end for Honest. 
            There's enough to see and find out in this game, so just like the main game, keep an eye out for every detail!</p>
