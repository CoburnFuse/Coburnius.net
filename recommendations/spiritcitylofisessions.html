            <p>I have a lot of trouble getting motivated, and I was always told to gamify my chores. However, I also found that to be a little bit difficult at times. 
            Then I found Spirit City. It combines a bunch of productivity tools with relaxing music, 
            as well as a slow paced game and a lot of customization options for the character and room.</p>

            <p>You can absolutely use everything separately, there's enough channels that stream relaxing music and atmosphere you can create with audio, 
            enough places and apps for timers, lists, etc. However, having it all in a single place with a relaxing vibe is just so much nicer. 
            The cute spirits that you can unlock, as well as the gamify aspect has helped me quite a bit.</p>

            <p>I tend to have this on my second monitor, usually having the character do whatever I do, 
            which is usually gaming or relaxing. I enjoy creating a cozy atmosphere with the sounds as well, 
            sometimes having some rainfall outside combined with the fireplace on. Sometimes just having some birds chirping etc. 
            It's amazing that you can just mix and match everything to your liking. Editing the room and the character is also something I really enjoy doing. 
            Sometimes I just feel like wanting a more industrial look, but at other times I just want a very Christmas-y vibe, it's all just possible.</p>

            <p>This app has personally helped me quite a bit getting motivation to at least start stuff. 
            Hell, during most of my chores and writing, I have it on, even if it's just for the cozy vibe. While it is mainly a productivity tool, 
            it's very cute design leaves me (and hopefully you) wanting it on at all times. 
            The developers are also actively engaged with the users, which too, is a great plus!</p>
