            <p class="recommendationQuote textCenter">“Fun things are fun!”</p>

            <p>One of the first anime I watched. I'm not sure what originally got me watching this, but I have zero regrets. 
            In fact, my first anime figure was one of Yui Hirasawa. This was even the only manga I had for the longest of times. 
            Obviously, the main theme of this anime is music, but it's more just cute girls doing cute things.</p>

            <p>The characters are fun and colorful. From the air-headed and energetic Yui, to the shy Mio. 
            While the focus lies on the main five (or four for the former half of the first season), the other characters are also great. 
            The interactions between characters are heart-warming, endearing, and generally cute and funny. While the first season is a little bit rushed, 
            the second season has a much better pace, but it's still a really good watch.</p>

            <p>Of course, it's also still an anime about music, and of course there are enough vocal songs. While not even close to every song is in the anime, 
            given how a lot of them are character songs, the songs are always a nice listen (and if you're at it, go listen to the character songs too!)</p>

            <p>If you want something comfy to watch, give K-ON a shot. The colorful cast and the interactions between them will surely make you smile. 
            And perhaps, just like me, you'll add a bunch of the songs to your playlist!</p>
