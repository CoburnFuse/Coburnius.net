        <p>Dust is a metroidvania-style game with a decent focus on brawling mechanics. While I'm typically not a big fan of metroidvania's, 
        this game completely captured me. When I first finished the game, I immediately said to myself: “Yep, this is my favorite game now.” 
        While this is no longer true because of Cassette Beasts, I still hold this game very close to my heart.</p>

        <p>What I find most impressive about this game is the graphics. (Pretty much) everything is hand-painted by the game's sole developer, Dean Dodrill. 
        As far as I know, only the voice acting, soundtrack, and a few bits and pieces of the story were not created by him. 
        The characters are also quite fun and well-written, though Fidget can sometimes be a little bit annoying (in a good way though!)</p>

        <p>Just like your typical metroidvania game, you are incentivized to go back to older areas when you unlock new abilities, 
        which it hints close to the beginning of the game too. Which is also something this game does well, it teaches you about the game creatively, 
        making use of narrative, rather than traditional help screens (or nothing.)</p>

        <p>If you want a good story driven metroidvania game, give Dust a try, you will absolutely not regret this. 
        And if you aren't convinced yet, just watch the trailer as well!</p>
