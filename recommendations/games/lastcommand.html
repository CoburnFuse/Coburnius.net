            <p>Snake is a well known game, but what if you'd combine it with a bullet hell?
            That's when you get Last Command. Like a few other games, I originally was drawn to the music. 
            It's (usually) energetic and intense, befitting of the battles.</p>

            <p>This is quite a unique game, combining snake and bullet hell together, but it works quite well. 
            It's difficult (and sometimes a bit frustrating), easy to understand, but hard to master and do right. 
            I have died countless times on a few specific bosses until I figured out how to handle it right. 
            Last Command made me appreciate harder games and made me learn to persevere. I had already mentioned the music, and it's absolutely fantastic.</p>

            <p>The main characters are also great. I'm personally quite fond of Fei, being a carefree but serious character. 
            That's not to say that other characters are any less great though. The style and theme of the game is also greatly to my liking, 
            being into futuristic stuff and everything.</p>

            <p>While this game is not for everyone, it's absolutely worth a shot if you are into bullet hells. 
            There is a demo/prologue if you want to try it out, which is something you should do nonetheless, since it is a prologue to the full game. 
            If you end up playing it, keep an eye out for every detail!</p>
