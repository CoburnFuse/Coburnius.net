        <p>When I finished CrossCode, there were a few loose ends that weren't addressed. 
        However, the questions that I had were answered after finishing the DLC. 
        I was fortunate enough that I didn't need to wait for the DLC to come out as I played it much later, 
        but I can imagine that a lot of people were incredibly excited when the story continued. And of course, Lea is still Lea, as great a character as ever.</p>

        <p>The story takes place a while after the main story ended. There are new areas to explore, new (this time less annoying for me!) puzzles to finish, 
        as well as a brand new big dungeon. The music and graphics are still just as amazing as the main game, and the content that has been added was fun to go through. 
        The boss of the last dungeon was fantastic and it did push me quite a bit as it was a lot harder (at least to me) than the bosses of the main game, 
        which was a very pleasant surprise to me. You can tell they have learned from and improved what was already a great game.</p>

        <p>My only gripe is that the final boss was not as tough as the boss before, 
        but I can forgive that since it was one of those more cinematic battles that I am always really fond of. 
        The new equipment that has been added also is a very nice addition, as you can basically improve your current equipment to be the same but better.</p>

        <p>While it is not as lengthy as the main game, you should really pick it up if you enjoyed the main game. 
        Especially since this gives a solid ending to an already great story, as well as more content to go through!</p>
