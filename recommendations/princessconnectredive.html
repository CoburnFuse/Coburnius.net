            <p>Originally I just watched this as a joke because it's from a gacha game. Yeah, I ended up watching all the episodes that were available 
            (which I think was eight at that point) back to back. I quickly became quite invested with the main characters, their stories, and the overall story too.</p>

            <p>It's hard to not talk about the cast when talking about this anime. The main characters, the gourmet guild, are such a colorful bunch. 
            It's not really a secret that I really like Pecorine, being all cheerful and bubbly (and air-headed.) 
            Another thing that stands out is how vibrant the anime is, and how amazing some scenes look. 
            There is one particular scene in the second season that is executed just perfectly in every way, and never fails to hype me up. 
            That being said, there are a bunch of scenes that are burned into my mind because of how great they were done.</p>

            <p>While generally the series is light-hearted and takes a very joke-y approach, there are some very sinister and serious moments, 
            which is a complete 180 to the light-heartedness. And honestly, it makes those scenes stand out even more, as it should. 
            The light-hearted scenes are generally cute and heart-warming.</p>

            <p>This anime has been a massive surprise hit for me. I have watched the anime multiple times at this point, and despite knowing the story, 
            I always get excited during it. Who knows, maybe it's a surprise hit for you as well!</p>
