            <p class="recommendationQuote textCenter">“In the middle of a dark, quiet room filled only by the sounds of humming machines, a figure floats, suspended.”</p>

            <p>While I am not entirely sure what first got me interested in playing this game, 
            I'm sure as hell happy that I did as I consider this (at the time of writing) to be in my top 5 favorite games of all time. 
            The simple hack-and-slash, narrator, and artstyle all play a good role on why I like this game so much.</p>

            <p>If you know The Stanley Parable, you are probably familiar with this kind of narration too. The narrator tells you what to do, 
            and you have to follow it, leading you to the end of the game. But just like The Stanley Parable, 
            there are many alternative paths if you choose to ignore the narrator, leading to funny dialogue and side content, 
            even content that is completely out of place, but somehow completely fits the tone of the game.</p>

            <p>The music, while there is not much, is very well done, some standing out a lot compared to the rest. 
            The combat is fast-paced, and while it can feel a little bit stiff, it feels very satisfying to pull off a solid combo on a boss. 
            And graphically it's also very appealing. The futuristic style combined with the hand-painted look.</p>

            <p>TotalBiscuit himself said it best, it's like they put The Stanley Parable and Dust in a blender, and got this. 
            If you play it, do not expect it to be a long game. Do however expect yourself to actually 100% the game and obtaining all achievements!</p>
