            <p>It's not really a secret that I like Touhou. So when I saw that a developer combined it with another thing I loved, which is DND, 
            I was quite eager to try it. The first demo didn't quite catch me, but after they updated it with new stuff, 
            I got really excited and I played through the demo multiple times.</p>

            <p>While it is not fully DND, it sure simulates the story telling really well. You only use two 6 sided dice at once, but with all kinds of numbers and effects. 
            Graphically, it really catches the tabletop RPG vibes completely, using minis for important figures, and cardboard figures for other characters. 
            Obviously, the story telling is also incredibly important, and it completely nails that as well for me. 
            Everything, aside from Marisa's dialogue, is voiced by a single narrator.</p>

            <p>Now, when you think of Touhou, you'll likely think of the music first (that, or the characters.) And well, the music is also amazing here. 
            The remixes of Koi-iro Master Spark for boss battles are amazing, but I may also be biased since it is one of my favorite tracks of Touhou, 
            but that aside. But also in classic Touhou fashion, there are some frustrating parts. Given how the entire game is based on the concept of TTRPGs, 
            the entire game is rolling dice, which means there is not exactly skill involved, and only luck. 
            Though, some strategic choices need to be made when selecting dice.</p>

            <p>While this is a Touhou fan game, I can still recommend it to people who have never played (or don't really enjoy) Touhou as a whole. 
            The game is completely story driven after all, and the focus on that shines through. 
            Of course, the game sure is not lacking the typical humor and character interactions, so you will likely get a good laugh out of dialogue too!</p>
