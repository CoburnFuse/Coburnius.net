            <p>For some, the name “Gridman” might sound familiar if you are into tokusatsu, because this is a kind of reboot/sequel of Gridman the Hyper Agent 
            (which is also a fun watch by the way!) A friend recommended it to me a while ago, and figured, why not? I ended up really enjoying it!</p>

            <p>Graphically, it looks fantastic, but then again, the studio is TRIGGER. I'm not expecting anything less from them. 
            It's vibrant and well drawn. The battles look awesome and gets me hyped up every time. I have caught myself cheering for the good guys, 
            punching the air each and every time, and probably got some neighbors annoyed by my excited screaming.</p>

            <p>The characters are well-written, and even the antagonist is very likeable. The story, while following the typical “monster of the week” style, 
            is very well done. There is proper character development and pretty much everything has a reason for existing or happening. 
            So looking out for details, and remembering stuff from previous episodes will absolutely improve the experience, 
            but even if you don't it will not hinder the enjoyment.</p>

            <p>This anime is definitely one I'd recommend to newcomer (and veteran) anime watchers. 
            While the sequel, SSSS.Dynazenon is not AS good as this one, you should also absolutely watch it if you liked this one!</p>
