            <p>Originally, I found out about this game through the soundtrack, which already got me quite excited. I saw the name a
            few times before, and all I knew beforehand is that it was another creature collector game. Little did I realize
            that it would quickly become my favorite game.</p>
        
            <p>While the music was what drew me to the game initially, I quickly started to enjoy the more unique (to me) stuff the
            game has. The type advantages and disadvantages for example give buffs or debuffs, depending on the elements being
            used, which can lead to fun chaos (or frustration sometimes.) Another fun element is the fusing feature, where you
            and your partner fuse together to become one stronger monster, and when doing this, the music gets even better since
            vocals are being added!</p>
        
            <p>The characters (both allies and enemies) are also great. While I like some more than others, there's no character
            that I dislike. Well, the main villain, but in a “it's written well” kind of way. The overall theme and style of the
            game is also great, everything has this feeling of retro. And the vibrancy in colors is always something I enjoy in
            games, even if it's in a pixel style.</p>
        
            <p>If you like creature collecting games, Cassette Beasts is absolutely worth your time, especially if you find music
            important and want something a bit more unique. Be sure to take a few good looks at the quest names too, as they spark some nostalgia!</p>
