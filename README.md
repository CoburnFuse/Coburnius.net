# Coburnius.net
My personal website hosted on a corner of the internet somewhere.

## Credits
- [FloatingMilkshake](https://github.com/FloatingMilkshake) for pushing me out of my stubbornness of wanting a fancy site that isn't even remotely as good as this.
- [Victoria Joh](https://www.vhjoh.com/) for the background image used on the site.
- Remi Gallego and Ryan Burge for the music in the mainframe "project".
- Andrew Paglinawan for the Quicksand font.
